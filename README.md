# streambot

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Python&message=3.11.5&color=%232b5b84&logo=python&logoColor=ffffff)

### Description
This is a very simple bot that shares custom messages to Discord channels when a user goes live on [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/). The configuration and setup is simple but requires the user to create the bot themselves in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Notes
This bot was created out of necessity as many other bots were not doing what we needed to the extent that we needed amongst my few friends without a subscription to some premium service. This bot is not meant to be a replacement for any other bot, but rather a simple solution for a small group of friends.
